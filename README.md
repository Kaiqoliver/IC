# IC
A repository for my research project, also called IC - 'Iniciação Científica'

My research project is about Deep Learning applied to Facial Recognition. The final goal is to create a model that will be able to recognize faces, of course. 

This repository has the purpose to store my practical and theorectical work. You can see a description of my project on the 'Projeto_IC__Kaique.pdf', it is in portuguese for now but I'll add an english version in the future. 

All the theory I have been able to learn so far is described in the 'diary_IC.pdf'. I will use it as a foundation for the reports that I'll need to write in the following months.

The practical side is intended to store every line of code that I end up writing in the process. For now, they are all '.ipynb' files.

Hope my work can be used as a source for beginners in the area.
